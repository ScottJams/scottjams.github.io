## About Me

Hi, I'm Scott Simpson and I'm a Developer based in the UK. Below you will find examples of the projects I've been working on and my previous experience as a developer.

## Experience

- **2 years as an iOS Developer** creating software for major airlines in an Agile environment - **Objective C, Swift, C#**
- **2 years** experience with Unity working on various solo projects such as *The Catacombs* - **Unity, C#**
    - *The Catacombs* - A turn-based strategy Roguelite, where a plucky gang of cats delve a dungeon to defeat the fearsome Necromeowncer.
    - *Project Whimsy* - A metroidvania prototype.
    - *Eye of the Storm* - An old-school survival horror prototype.
    - Various Game Jam entries such as *Moonshot* and *Fallen*, used as learning tools to develop specific skills.
- **BSc Computing Science** - Final paper on game development in Unity - **Unity, C#**
- **1 year** experience with UE4 through University & personal use - **Unreal Engine, C++** 

&nbsp;

# AI and Pathfinding

In *The Catacombs*, I created my own implementation of the **A\* pathfinding algorithm** to control pathfinding and movement for player and enemy units.

## Pathfinding Scope

The scope for my pathfinding system for *The Catacombs* was that it should meet the following requirements:
- Allows for pathfinding across a 2D grid comprised of nodes.
- Uses the A* pathfinding algorithm.
- Can return the shortest path, given any two nodes.
- Can return all the nodes within a given maximum movement range.

## Pathfinding Usage

- Initialise `PathfindingNode` objects, supplying their positions on the grid and whether or not they can be traversed.
- Initialise a `PathfindingGrid` object, supplying the nodes to be connected on the grid, and optionally the heuristic to use for distance calculations.
- Call public function `FindPath` on the `PathfindingGrid` to get the path between any two given nodes.
- Call public function `NodesInRange` on the `PathfindingGrid` to get all of the nodes within a given movement range.

# Loot System

In *The Catacombs*, I created a loot system allowing the player to find and equip new gear as they explore the dungeon.

<center><video src="https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/69112024/288801611-6a5b33bf-2190-4d9e-b169-cb8eddb11378.mp4" controls="controls" style="max-width: 1050px;">
</video></center>
&nbsp;

The video shows the character *Mitzi* finishing off an enemy - you can see the attack radius of the unit is set to a 3x3 square. After clearing the round, the player chooses to take a new item - the Tome of Terror!
After equipping the Tome, the new stats afforded by the item are applied and *Mitzi's* range of attack is increased dramatically, but deals slightly less damage.

&nbsp;

# Player Controllers

In *Project Whimsy*, I used a finite state machine to compartmentalise movement and actions into individual states. 

<center><video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69112024/152352692-f6ee8042-9aa2-4a7e-8ee9-fdceab6ab3b8.mp4" controls="controls" style="max-width: 1050px;">
</video></center>

# Dialogue systems

In *Fallen*, I created my own closed captioning system to display dialogue and provide text descriptions for sound effects. 

<center><video src="
https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69112024/153856779-6cf8b766-5675-4564-863b-94b6058dc5b9.mp4" controls="controls" style="max-width: 1050px;">
</video></center>

In *Project Whimsy*, I utilised the [Ink narrative scripting language by Inkle](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) to display contextual dialogue options and responses. 

<center><video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69112024/153493429-8adbd973-761a-4d42-88f0-8c7ba92a63dc.mp4" controls="controls" style="max-width: 1050px;">
</video></center>

The Ink script contains all of the game's dialogue alongside the logic which determines which dialogue to display next. The Ink script is exported in **json** and accessed via the [Ink for Unity C# API](https://github.com/inkle/ink-unity-integration), allowing us to easily determine which dialogue to display on screen based upon the players previous choices and progress.

When we speak with a character, our `DialogueManager` defers to that characters `decider` section in the Ink script which contains the logic for deciding which text to display. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69112024/153217288-eac3fb80-074d-4d8d-9400-c32714c07b57.PNG"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69112024/153217266-437a4c6e-108e-4e82-9177-7dfa6b3514a6.PNG"/>
</p>

The API returns the appropriate dialogue line (or choices). Our `DialogueManager` sends an event to the dialogue UI and lets the logic play out in the Ink script. Once there is no more dialogue to display, we close the UI and gameplay resumes.

## Animation

In *The Catacombs*, I created, rigged, and animated 2D sprites, making use of Inverse Kinematics to create some "bouncy" animations. These animations were created to suit the "quirky" nature of the cat characters in *The Catacombs*

In *Fallen*, I imported animations from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com) and used an `Animator` to transition between them as appropriate. I also used `Animations` for fading in and out during scene transitions.

Since this was a game jam project, I didn't commit to fully fleshing it out with animations such as rotating in position, moving diagonally, moving backwards and so forth - but it was a good introduction to blending between more complex `Animation` timelines.

I also used `Animators` in *Moonshot* for basic UI effects, such as when picking up collectibles.

# Audio

In *Fallen*, I used a lot of spatial audio to contribute to the overall atmosphere.

I also used various `AudioFilters` to create interesting effects, such as a `Low Pass Filter` to create this muffled-sounding argument.

In all of these clips you can see that I tied sound effects to the player's `Animation` timeline to play sounds during walking animations. When the player's foot touches the ground during the `Walking` and `Running` states, an `AnimationEvent` is triggered. A script then checks for which type of ground we're currently walking over (wooden, concrete etc) and plays an appropriate sound effect. There's a good variety of sound effects for each different type of terrain in order to avoid repetition.
